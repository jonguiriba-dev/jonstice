## Notes

Figured to do some foundation work for my app idea. Its supposed to be like Reddit where you post something
and people are free to comment and judge it with emphasis on judging. The idea is what if Reddit but focused on
judging stuff presented in an entertaining manner.

### Addtional Notes

- Tried my best to showcase what I know. Although I have a 30(FE)/70(BE) split, I spent more time on FE since I'm new to React and barely any BE
  since it would require more time to do anything complicated BE-wise.
- Added some comments to what I think should be and what is.
- Figured that I could've just accessed Firebase directly in FE but did BE for an HTTP Request interaction.
